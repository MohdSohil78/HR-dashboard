The HR analytics dashboard reveals a 16.12% attrition rate among 1,470 employees, with the highest attrition in the 26–35 age group and among employees with Life Sciences and Medical education backgrounds. Roles like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive experience the most attrition. Lower salary bands (up to 5K) show significantly higher turnover, indicating a strong correlation between pay and retention. Employees with shorter tenures (0–2 years) also have higher attrition. Male employees show slightly higher attrition than females. These trends highlight a need to improve compensation, engagement, and career development, especially for younger and lower-paid employees in high-turnover job roles.
